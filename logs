Yes! If you prefer a simpler approach without using class-based inheritance, you can implement the WebdriverIO Custom Reporter using a functional approach in TypeScript or JavaScript.


---

✅ Alternative: Functional WebdriverIO Custom Reporter (No Class)

Instead of extending Reporter, you can directly define and export functions inside a module.

📄 Create customLogger.ts inside tests/e2e/reporters/

import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

const logFilePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'tests/e2e/reports/wdio-e2e.log');

/**
 * Helper function to write logs to a file
 */
function writeLog(message: string) {
    const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
    const logMessage = `[${timeStamp}] ${message}\n`;
    fs.appendFileSync(logFilePath, logMessage, { encoding: 'utf8' });
}

export const CustomLogger = {
    onTestStart: (test: any) => {
        writeLog(`STARTING TEST: ${test.title}`);
    },
    onTestPass: (test: any) => {
        writeLog(`✅ TEST PASSED: ${test.title}`);
    },
    onTestFail: (test: any) => {
        writeLog(`❌ TEST FAILED: ${test.title}`);
        if (test.error) {
            writeLog(`ERROR: ${test.error.message}`);
        }
    },
    onTestEnd: (test: any) => {
        writeLog(`TEST ENDED: ${test.title}`);
    },
    onSuiteStart: (suite: any) => {
        writeLog(`📌 SUITE STARTED: ${suite.title}`);
    },
    onSuiteEnd: (suite: any) => {
        writeLog(`📌 SUITE ENDED: ${suite.title}`);
    },
    onRunnerEnd: () => {
        writeLog(`🎯 TEST RUN COMPLETED`);
    }
};


---

✅ Step 2: Register in wdio.conf.ts

📄 Modify wdio.conf.ts

import { CustomLogger } from './tests/e2e/reporters/customLogger';

export const config: WebdriverIO.Config = {
    reporters: [
        'spec',  // Keep the default Spec Reporter for console logs
        CustomLogger // Use functional logger
    ],
};


---

✅ Why This is Better?

1. No need for a class – uses a simple object with functions.


2. More readable – just functions that WebdriverIO calls at different events.


3. No need to extend Reporter – WebdriverIO directly calls our exported functions.

✅ Works Exactly Like Before!

🚀 Run your test suite, and logs will be saved inside:

tests/e2e/reports/wdio-e2e.log

✅ Example log output:

[2025-02-18T14:35:01.987Z] 📌 SUITE STARTED: User Dashboard Tests
[2025-02-18T14:35:05.312Z] STARTING TEST: Validates total value for TestUser
[2025-02-18T14:35:08.212Z] ✅ TEST PASSED: Validates total value for TestUser
[2025-02-18T14:35:12.198Z] STARTING TEST: Validates latest payment value for TestUser
[2025-02-18T14:35:15.789Z] ❌ TEST FAILED: Validates latest payment value for TestUser
[2025-02-18T14:35:15.789Z] ERROR: Expected £343.75 but found £0.00
[2025-02-18T14:35:18.001Z] 📌 SUITE ENDED: User Dashboard Tests
[2025-02-18T14:35:20.453Z] 🎯 TEST RUN COMPLETED


---

✅ Bonus: Upload Logs in CI

If you want to upload the log file as an artifact in GitHub Actions, modify your .github/workflows/e2e-pipeline.yml:

- name: Upload WebdriverIO Logs
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: wdio-logs
    path: tests/e2e/reports/wdio-e2e.log
    retention-days: 7

Great choice! Using a WebdriverIO Custom Reporter will help you structure your logs properly while keeping everything within WebdriverIO's ecosystem. Below is a step-by-step guide to implementing a custom reporter that logs test execution details to a file.


---

Step 1: Create a Custom Reporter File

WebdriverIO allows us to create a custom reporter by extending the Reporter class. Let's create a new reporter file:

📁 Directory Structure:

tests/
  ├── e2e/
  │   ├── reports/
  │   │   ├── wdio-e2e.log
  │   ├── reporters/
  │   │   ├── customLogger.ts

📌 Create customLogger.ts inside tests/e2e/reporters/


---

Step 2: Implement the Custom Reporter

📄 customLogger.ts

import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import { Reporter } from '@wdio/reporter';

export default class CustomLogger extends Reporter {
    private logFilePath: string;

    constructor(options: any) {
        super(options);
        this.logFilePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'tests/e2e/reports/wdio-e2e.log');
    }

    /**
     * Helper function to write logs to a file
     */
    private writeLog(message: string) {
        const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
        const logMessage = `[${timeStamp}] ${message}\n`;
        fs.appendFileSync(this.logFilePath, logMessage, { encoding: 'utf8' });
    }

    /**
     * Called when a test starts
     */
    public onTestStart(test: any) {
        this.writeLog(`STARTING TEST: ${test.title}`);
    }

    /**
     * Called when a test passes
     */
    public onTestPass(test: any) {
        this.writeLog(`✅ TEST PASSED: ${test.title}`);
    }

    /**
     * Called when a test fails
     */
    public onTestFail(test: any) {
        this.writeLog(`❌ TEST FAILED: ${test.title}`);
        if (test.error) {
            this.writeLog(`ERROR: ${test.error.message}`);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Called when a test completes (pass or fail)
     */
    public onTestEnd(test: any) {
        this.writeLog(`TEST ENDED: ${test.title}`);
    }

    /**
     * Called when the suite starts
     */
    public onSuiteStart(suite: any) {
        this.writeLog(`📌 SUITE STARTED: ${suite.title}`);
    }

    /**
     * Called when the suite ends
     */
    public onSuiteEnd(suite: any) {
        this.writeLog(`📌 SUITE ENDED: ${suite.title}`);
    }

    /**
     * Called when all tests finish execution
     */
    public onRunnerEnd() {
        this.writeLog(`🎯 TEST RUN COMPLETED`);
    }
}


---

Step 3: Register the Custom Reporter in wdio.conf.ts

Now that we have our custom reporter, we need to register it inside the WebdriverIO configuration file.

📄 Modify wdio.conf.ts

import CustomLogger from './tests/e2e/reporters/customLogger';

export const config: WebdriverIO.Config = {
    reporters: [
        'spec',  // Keep the default Spec Reporter for console logs
        [CustomLogger, {}] // Add our custom logger
    ],
};


---

Step 4: Run Tests and View Logs

Once you run your test suite, WebdriverIO will automatically write test execution details to:

tests/e2e/reports/wdio-e2e.log

✅ Example log output:

[2025-02-18T14:35:01.987Z] 📌 SUITE STARTED: User Dashboard Tests
[2025-02-18T14:35:05.312Z] STARTING TEST: Validates total value for TestUser
[2025-02-18T14:35:08.212Z] ✅ TEST PASSED: Validates total value for TestUser
[2025-02-18T14:35:12.198Z] STARTING TEST: Validates latest payment value for TestUser
[2025-02-18T14:35:15.789Z] ❌ TEST FAILED: Validates latest payment value for TestUser
[2025-02-18T14:35:15.789Z] ERROR: Expected £343.75 but found £0.00
[2025-02-18T14:35:18.001Z] 📌 SUITE ENDED: User Dashboard Tests
[2025-02-18T14:35:20.453Z] 🎯 TEST RUN COMPLETED


---

Bonus: Upload Log File in CI Pipeline

If you want to upload the log file as an artifact in GitHub Actions, modify your .github/workflows/e2e-pipeline.yml:

- name: Upload WebdriverIO Logs
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: wdio-logs
    path: tests/e2e/reports/wdio-e2e.log
    retention-days: 7


---

Conclusion

🚀 Now you have structured logs inside a WebdriverIO Custom Reporter!

This integrates directly with WebdriverIO's lifecycle.

It writes structured logs to a file.

You don't need Winston anymore.

It automatically logs test execution without manual function calls.


Next Steps:
✅ Run the test suite and verify tests/e2e/reports/wdio-e2e.log is being generated.
✅ Update your CI pipeline to upload logs as artifacts.

Let me know if you need any refinements! 🚀

Since you want to use WebdriverIO’s custom reporter but without using classes, you'll need an alternative way to hook into WebdriverIO’s lifecycle events while still registering a custom reporter.


---

🚀 Implementing WebdriverIO Custom Reporter in a Functional Way

While WebdriverIO’s Reporter requires class-based extension, you can wrap it in a function-based approach by creating a factory function.


---

1️⃣ Create a Custom Reporter (customLogger.ts)

Since we can’t directly extend the Reporter class in a function, we create a wrapper function that registers event handlers dynamically.

import Reporter from '@wdio/reporter';
import { appendFileSync } from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';

// Log file path setup
const logFilePath = join(process.cwd(), 'logs/wdio-e2e.log');

// Helper function to write logs
function writeLog(message: string) {
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    const logMessage = `[${timestamp}] ${message}\n`;
    appendFileSync(logFilePath, logMessage, { encoding: 'utf-8' });
}

// ✅ Function-based WebdriverIO Custom Reporter
export function createCustomReporter() {
    const reporter = new Reporter({});

    reporter.on('suite:start', (suite) => {
        writeLog(`🟠 SUITE STARTED: ${suite.title}`);
    });

    reporter.on('suite:end', (suite) => {
        writeLog(`🟢 SUITE ENDED: ${suite.title}`);
    });

    reporter.on('test:start', (test) => {
        writeLog(`🔵 STARTING TEST: ${test.title}`);
    });

    reporter.on('test:pass', (test) => {
        writeLog(`✅ TEST PASSED: ${test.title}`);
    });

    reporter.on('test:fail', (test) => {
        writeLog(`❌ TEST FAILED: ${test.title}`);
    });

    reporter.on('runner:end', (runner) => {
        const status = runner.failures > 0 ? 'FAILED' : 'PASSED';
        writeLog(`🚀 TEST RUN COMPLETED`);
        writeLog(`🔹 FINAL STATUS: ${status}`);
    });

    return reporter;
}


---

2️⃣ Register Custom Reporter in wdio.conf.ts

Since WebdriverIO expects reporters to be registered via configuration, we call our function inside wdio.conf.ts.

import { createCustomReporter } from './utils/customLogger';

export const config: WebdriverIO.Config = {
    // Other WebdriverIO settings...
    
    reporters: [
        [createCustomReporter()], // ✅ Registering function-based reporter
    ],
};


---

📌 How This Works

✔️ createCustomReporter() returns a Reporter instance but is written without classes
✔️ Lifecycle event handlers (on) listen dynamically
✔️ Direct function-based logging is used (writeLog)
✔️ No need to extend a class!


---

🔹 Should You Use This?

✅ If you want WebdriverIO’s Custom Reporter but in a function-based structure
✅ If you want lighter, modular logging without class inheritance
✅ If you want flexibility in how logs are handled


---

🚀 Summary


---

💡 Final Thought

Since WebdriverIO officially requires extending Reporter, if you absolutely need a custom reporter, the class-based method is recommended. But this function-based workaround lets you modularize logging while using WebdriverIO’s reporting API.
