📌 Refactored Section: Self-Signed SSL Certificate Setup

Self-Signed SSL Certificate Setup for HTTPS Proxy

To enable HTTPS routing via the reverse proxy, a self-signed SSL certificate must be generated and placed in the scripts/utils folder. Follow these steps:

1️⃣ Generate SSL Certificate and Private Key using OpenSSL

Open a bash terminal and navigate to your project's scripts/utils directory.

Run the following command to generate the certificate and private key:

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 99999 -nodes


2️⃣ Handle Prompts During Generation

Press Enter for all options except the Common Name (CN).

Enter the domain name when prompted for CN:

Common Name (CN): local.welcome.standardlife.co.uk


3️⃣ Ensure the Certificate and Key Are Stored in scripts/utils

The generated cert.pem and key.pem files will be placed in the directory where the command was run.

If they are generated elsewhere, move them manually to scripts/utils inside your project directory.


4️⃣ Verify the Proxy Automatically Uses the SSL Certificate

When running the frontend/backend servers, the reverse proxy will start and route requests via HTTPS automatically.

✅ Now, your HTTPS proxy is ready to handle secure requests! 🚀
