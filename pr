Here's the updated Reverse Proxy Server task with an added comment explaining its role in notifying dependent tasks:

{
  "label": "Reverse Proxy Server", // Task to start the HTTPS reverse proxy server
  "type": "shell",
  "command": "pnpm",
  "args": ["run", "--filter=scripts", "proxyServer"], // Runs the proxyServer script from the scripts package
  "isBackground": true, // Keeps the process running in the background, allowing other tasks to start
  "problemMatcher": {
    "pattern": {
      "regexp": "HTTPS Reverse Proxy running at .*" // Detects when the proxy server has started
    }
  },
  "background": {
    "activeOnStart": true, // Marks the task as active when it starts
    "beginsPattern": "Starting Reverse Proxy Server...", // Recognizes when the proxy server begins initializing
    "endsPattern": "HTTPS Reverse Proxy running at .*" // Marks task as complete once the proxy server is fully running
  }
}

Additional Clarification

Problem Matcher: Helps notify dependent tasks that this proxy server has started successfully and is running.

Runs in Background: Ensures that frontend and backend servers dependent on this proxy can start without waiting indefinitely.


This makes it explicit that other tasks depending on the proxy will recognize when it starts and completes.

Let me know if you need more refinements!
