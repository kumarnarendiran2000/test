I have multiple test packs because different scenarios have different total values and contribution elements. For example, some have "Total Transfer Value" instead of "Transfer Value," and sole employees might have "Total Cash Free Plan" and "Total Net Withdrawal," which others donâ€™t. To ensure we cover all these variations properly, I set up multiple test packs.
